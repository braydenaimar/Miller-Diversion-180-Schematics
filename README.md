# Miller-Diversion-180-Schematics

These schematics were created by tracing out individual circuit paths on the PCB's for the remote controls and the main logic board inside the welder unit. I produced these schematics in the process of diagnosing and fixing foot and hand control problems. I primarily focussed on the circuitry on the main processing boarding inside the welder involving the remote controls. Therefore these schematics are not intended to be compete.

All values for resistance and capacitance were measured across the respective components while in circuit. As a result, some values may be skewed by other components in parallel. I did not provide values for most capacitors as I felt the measurements were too greatly skewed by neighbouring components.

The Miller Diversion 165 is compatible with the hand and foot controls of the Diversion 180. Therefore, I suspect the input circuitry for the main logic board will be very similar if not the same.
